### 💡 Inspiration

This project was born from the Latin dance community in Denver - a community that is near and dear to my heart. As a salsa instructor, I've witnessed the power of dance to connect people and create a sense of belonging. I wanted to create a project that celebrates this community and the spaces where it happens.
